# Blockchain
Simulated blockchain created for a fake cryptocurrency called KFT. It is not decentralized but simulates how a blockchain works using crypto transactions.

Features: 
Generation of wallet.
Send and receive transactions anonymously.
Mine unconfirmed blocks for rewards.
A clear view of the confirmed and unconfirmed blockchain.

Transactions do not appear in your wallet unless someone has mined and confirmed the blocks. Because the blockchain runs on UTXO (unspent transaction outputs).
